# shopping-api

Hey there! This is a node.js project that I am working on. It's my first time buidling an API and using node.js so fingers crossed. The project will be a shopping API, I will be implementing bcrypt for password hashing for users, and I am using MongoDB for my database.

More to come as the project expands!
